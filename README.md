## What is it?

Detecting human faces and recognizing faces and facial expressions has always been an area of interest for different applications such as games, utilities and even security. With the advancement of machine learning, the techniques of detection and recognition have become more accurate and precise than ever before.

However, machine learning remains a relatively complex field that could feel intimidating or inaccessible to many of us. Luckily, in the last couple of years, several organizations and open source communities have been developing tools and libraries that help abstract the complex mathematical agorithms in order to encourage developers to easily create learning models and train them using any programming languages. 

As part of this study, I created a Javascript framework built on top of the work of several open source projects and models with the hope to reduce the entry barrier for developers and to encourage them to focus more on developing innovative applications that make use of face detection and recognition.


## Credits & Resources

* [face-api library](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/): this project uses the face api javascript library developed by Vincent Muhler

* FaceDetect framework: Proprietary open source framework that I created to make the use of the face-api library easier to use and to integrate with Vue JS. The framework is included in the distribution (detect.js)

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): Tensor flow is an end-to-end open source platform with comprehensive tools and libraries that lets developers easily build machine learning powered applications.

* [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/): ML5 is an open source library, with exhaustive documentation and tutorials for understanding machine learning algorithms and how to use TensorFlow Models



## Let's get started

### Installation

The FaceDetect package can be downloaded from Github by either downloading the ZIP folder or by running the following command from the terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DoryAzar/facedetect.git

```

### Testing the package

Once the FaceDetect package is downloaded, you can test it by running the out-of-the-box application that comes with it.
In order to run that application, navigate to the folder where FaceDetect was downloaded then run `facedetect > app > basic > index.html` by double clicking on the `index.html`. 

If you downloaded the package in your server root then you should be able to run it directly through this url: <http://localhost/facedetect/app/basic>
